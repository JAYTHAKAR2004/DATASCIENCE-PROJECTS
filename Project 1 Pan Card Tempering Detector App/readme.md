# 🛂 Pan Card Tempering Detector App

A machine learning-powered **Streamlit web application** that detects whether a PAN card has been tampered with or not using image classification. This project is ideal for document verification use-cases in KYC systems.

---

## 📌 Features

- Upload a PAN card image (original or tampered)
- Predicts whether the document is genuine or tampered
- Built using **OpenCV**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and **Streamlit**
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to use via browser
- Deployed on **Heroku** for quick public access
